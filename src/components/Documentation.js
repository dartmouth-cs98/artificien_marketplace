            <p>
              This documentation outlines how to integrate your existing iOS app with Artificien's on-device training.
              Before you do this, please fill out <NavLink to="/upload_data">the form here</NavLink> to register your
              app and describe its data. You can also read our <NavLink to="/how_it_works">How It Works</NavLink> page
              to understand how your app fits into the Artificien ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
              Integrating Artificien's on-device training with your existing iOS app is extremely simple. At a high level,
              it consists of 2 steps: setting up the Artificien CocoaPod and passing your data to Artificien's training
              function through a background task. We'll show you how to do both below, in under 10 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following the below instructions closely is absolutely essential in order to make your app's data available
              on the Artificien platform. Please reach out if you have any questions, comments, or concerns about this material.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Note:</strong> Artificien is distributed through the CocoaPods framework and is thus only compatible with Swift
              and Objective-C Cocoa projects (in other words, native Swift apps built within Xcode). It cannot be used with
              any Android-compatible or ReactNative applications.
            </p>

            <h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
            <p>
              Artificien's training functions are accessible through the Artificien CocoaPod. If your iOS app already uses
              CocoaPods, jump straight to <a href="#installArtificien">installing the Artificien pod</a>. Otherwise, start
              directly below.
            </p>

            <h3 id="installCocoapods">Install and initialize CocoaPods</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Note:</strong> for the latest instructions on setting up CocoaPods, follow <a href="https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html">the official documentation</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              To start, run the following code via the command line, in any directory. This will install CocoaPods, a package
              and dependency manager for iOS, on your machine. Your machine may ask for your password before beginning the
              installation.
            </p>
            <CopyBlock
              text="sudo gem install cocoapods"
              language="shell"
              showLineNumbers
              theme={dracula}
              codeBlock
            />
            <p>
              Now run the following via the command line, in the root directory of your iOS project (the one that contains your
              <code>.xcodeproj</code> file). This creates a <code>Podfile</code> that you will use to configure CocoaPod dependencies.
            </p>
            <CopyBlock
              text="pod init"
              language="shell"
              showLineNumbers
              theme={dracula}
              codeBlock
            />

            <h3 id="installArtificien">Install the Artificien Pod</h3>
            <p>
              Open your <code>Podfile</code> and add Artificien as a dependency to your project with the following line. Our pod is
              distributed through <a href="https://github.com/dartmouth-cs98/artificien_ios_library">an open-source Github repository</a>.
            </p>
            <CopyBlock
              text="pod 'Artificien', :git => 'https://github.com/dartmouth-cs98/artificien_ios_library.git'"
              language="python"
              showLineNumbers
              theme={dracula}
              codeBlock
            />
            <p>Your <code>Podfile</code> should now look something like this.</p>
            <CopyBlock
              text={podfileCode}
              language="python"
              showLineNumbers
              theme={dracula}
              codeBlock
            />
            <p>
              Now run the following, in the same directory as your <code>Podfile</code>, to download Artificien. This will
              install the Artificien package and create a new file with the <code>.xcworkspace</code> extension in your
              current directory. Use this file, instead of the standard <code>.xcodeproj</code> file, for future development
              in order for your app to access Artificien's functions.
            </p>
            <CopyBlock
              text="pod install"
              language="shell"
              showLineNumbers
              theme={dracula}
              codeBlock
            />
            <p>
              At this point, open the <code>.xcworkspace</code> file to view your project in Xcode.
            </p>

            <h3 id="enableBackground">Enable background tasks</h3>
            <p>
              Background Task Scheduler was introduced in iOS 13 as a way to run background tasks for maintenance, content
              updates, or machine learning. We will be setting these up in your iOS app to allow Artificien to run federated
              learning tasks in the background.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Note:</strong> Apple requires use of iOS 13.0 or higher in order to execute background tasks. If your
              application has a lower deployment target, only those devices with iOS 13.0 will be able to run the Artificien's
              training functions. For the latest instructions on setting up background tasks in iOS,
              follow <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks/bgtaskscheduler">the official documentation</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              1. Open the project editor in Xcode (the blue icon in the file pane) and select the desired target.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Click Signing &amp; Capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Expand the Background Modes section. If there’s no Background Modes section, click the “+ Capability” button
              and choose Background Modes in the window that appears.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. Select both the check boxes for both Background fetch and Background processing.
            </p>
            <img src={enableBackgroundTasksImage} alt="Xcode screenshot" />

            <h3 id="registerBackgroundID">Register a task ID</h3>
            <p>
              We've now enabled the background task capability in your app. But the system runs only tasks registered
              with identifiers on a list of permitted task identifiers. To create this list, we need to add the identifiers
              to the <code>Info.plist</code> file.
            </p>
            <p>
              1. Open the Project navigator and select your target.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Click Info and expand "Custom iOS Target Properties."
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Add a new item to the list and choose “Permitted background task scheduler identifiers,” which corresponds
              to the <code>BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers</code> array.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. Add the following String to the array, marking it as an authorized task identifier. The key will default
              to "Item 0." We will use this unique identifier later when implementing the background task.
            </p>
            <CopyBlock
              text="com.artificien.background"
              language="shell"
              showLineNumbers
              theme={dracula}
              codeBlock
            />
            <img src={registerTaskIDImage} alt="Xcode screenshot" />

            <h3 id="configureInfo">Configure Info.plist</h3>
            <p>
              We will need to add 2 additional configuration properties before moving on from this section. Both are
              default iOS properties that should auto-fill when you search for them.
            </p>
            <p>
              1. Add an item to the property list called "Privacy - Camera Usage Description." This allows you to display
              a message to your users in the case that you need to access their camera. No part of Artificien's library uses
              the camera by default, but some portions of the federated learning codebase do trigger a privacy warning during
              App Store deployment that requires you to input a description.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Add a dictionary called "App Transport Security Settings." Within this, add a Boolean called "Allow Arbitrary
              Loads" and set its value to "YES." This will allow Artificien to connect to its orchestration layer over HTTP
              and download the models that need to train on your app.
            </p>
            <img src={configureInfoImage} alt="Xcode screenshot" />

            <h3 id="configureArtificien">Configure Artificien.plist</h3>
            <p>
              The final step before using Artificien in your codebase is to store the keys needed to uniquely identify
              your app. This is accomplished by creating a new <code>.plist</code> file.
            </p>
            <p>
              Create a new file called <code>Artificien.plist</code>, in the same directory that contains your <code>Info.plist</code> file.
              This is where your unique key will be stored, and for this reason we recommend keeping this file out of source
              control (typically by adding it to your <code>.gitignore</code>).
            </p>
            <p>
              After creating and removing the file from source control, locate and open the file as a property list in Xcode
              and add a single key called "dataset_id" of type String. For the value, input the name of the dataset you are
              currently setting up. You can find a list of all datasets you've registered on your Profile page.
            </p>
            <img src={configureArtificienImage} alt="Xcode screenshot" />
            <p>
              The Artificien library will look for this file and use the key within it to authenticate and filter its
              communication with the Artificien orchestration layer when downloading models and sending training updates.
            </p>

            <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
            <p>
              You are now ready to integrate Artificien with your codebase to perform on-device training. By installing the
              CocoaPod and configuring those <code>.plist</code> files, you've given your application access to Artificien's
              library. Training can be achieved with under 20 lines of code, most of which you can simply copy and paste from
              below.
            </p>
            <p>
              All of the training happens within your <code>AppDelegate.swift</code> file, where your background task will
              be registered and run. Open that file — it's typically in your Xcode project's root directory.
            </p>

            <h3 id="importArtificien">Import Artificien</h3>
            <p>
              To begin, you will need to import the Artificien library. At the top of the file, together with any other
              import statements, paste the following line.
            </p>
            <CopyBlock
              text="import Artificien"
              language="swift"
              showLineNumbers
              theme={dracula}
              codeBlock
            />

            <h3 id="scheduleTraining">Schedule training</h3>
            <p>
              Now, we will register a background task within the <code>application(didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)</code> function.
            </p>
            <p>
              Paste the following code within that function. Here we register a closure to be called whenever the system wants to
              execute a background task for your app. Inside this closure is where we'll execute federated learning tasks, like
              searching for and executing a model training cycle. We use the same task identifier for this call that we registered
              earlier in our <code>Info.plist</code>.
            </p>
            <CopyBlock
              text={registerBackgroundTask}
              language="swift"
              showLineNumbers
              theme={dracula}
              codeBlock
            />
            <p>
              The <code>train</code> function above is where most of the federated learning magic occurs. You're welcome to
              access our open-source repository to understand how we package and use your data to train locally in conjunction
              with the <a href="https://github.com/OpenMined/SwiftSyft">SwiftSyft library</a> from OpenMined.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, paste the following code below the code from the previous section. Here we specify a <code>BGProcessingTaskRequest</code>,
              again with the same task identifier. While configuring this, we need to specify that the phone should be
              charging, which removes the CPU usage limits for processing tasks. We also need to specify network connectivity,
              since we need to connect to Artificien's orchestration layer to download models and submit the results of our
              training. These 2 parameters also ensure training doesn't maliciously use device resources.
            </p>
            <CopyBlock
              text={processingTaskRequest}
              language="swift"
              showLineNumbers
              theme={dracula}
              codeBlock
            />
            <p>
              If you've done this correctly, your <code>AppDelegate.swift</code> file should look something like the following.
            </p>
            <CopyBlock
              text={appDelegate}
              language="swift"
              showLineNumbers
              theme={dracula}
              codeBlock
            />

            <h3 id="dataPreparation">Write data preparation functions</h3>
            <p>
              In the step above, you'll notice the functions <code>prepareTrainingDictionary()</code> and <code>prepareValidationDictionary()</code>,
              the outputs of which are passed to the Artificien <code>train</code> function. These functions are not a part of
              the Artificien library, and will throw an error in Xcode — they're placeholders for functions you will write that
              prepare your app's data to pass to the training function.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you registered your dataset with Artificien, you described your app's attributes: these are what should
              be passed to Artificien's <code>train</code> function in the form of a Swift dictionary. Below is the expected
              dictionary format for your application's data. Your <code>prepareTrainingDictionary()</code> and <code>prepareValidationDictionary()</code>
              functions should collect your on-device data and return it as a dictionary, with these exact keys and values
              as Booleans, Floats, or Strings.

            <p>
              As a data scientist, or client, you will be purchasing access to Artificien datasets and writing models in PyTorch to train
              on those datasets on-device. The Artificien Python library enables you to set up and trigger a federated learning training
              cycle with a model of your design. To understand the full app developer flow, reference our <NavLink to="/how_it_works">How It Works</NavLink> page.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following is a basic use guide for <code>artificienlib</code> in Jupyter. For more step-by-step documentation, refer to the tutorials
              in <a href="https://github.com/dartmouth-cs98/artificien_experimental">Artificien's experimental repository</a> under
              the <code>deploymentExamples</code> folder.
            </p>

            <h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

            <h3 id="installLib">Install artificienlib</h3>
            <p>
              Run the following in the command line. This installs the library as a Python package.
            </p>
            <CopyBlock
              text="pip install artificienlib"
              language="shell"

              theme={dracula}
              codeBlock
            />

            <h3 id="importLib">Import artificienlib</h3>
            <p>
              In your Python file, prior to using <code>artificienlib</code>, add the following line.
            </p>
            <CopyBlock
              text="import artificienlib"
              language="python"

              theme={dracula}
              codeBlock
            />
            <p>
              You are now ready to use Artificien's library to build and deploy a model.
            </p>

            <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
            <p>
              Building a model with Artificien consists of 5 steps.
            </p>

            <h3 id="selectDataset">Select a dataset</h3>
            <p>
              The first step is selecting a dataset. You can build a model to train on any single dataset you've purchased
              access to. You can check which datasets you've purchased within your Profile page, or programmatically.
            </p>
            <p>
              To print available datasets programmatically, run the following in Python.
            </p>
            <CopyBlock
              text={printDatasets}
              language="python"
              showLineNumbers
              theme={dracula}
              codeBlock
            />
            <p>
              Record the printed dataset_id of the dataset you'd like to use: you'll need it later.
            </p>

            <h3 id="buildModel">Build a PyTorch model</h3>
            <p>
              The second step is specifying a standard PyTorch model of some input and output size. This process is
              no different than using standard PyTorch. Refer to PyTorch documentation for additional information, and to
              <code>model_lib.ipynb</code> in <a href="https://github.com/dartmouth-cs98/artificien_experimental">Artificien's experimental repository</a> for
              an example.
            </p>

            <h3 id="definePlan">Define a training plan</h3>
            <p>
              The third step is defining a training plan. First, we must choose some dummy X and Y representative of our input
              and output parameters respectively. The X should be sample size 1 example of inputs, and Y the corresponding output.
              Such values, along with our pytorch model, are passed into our training plan definition. To compile the training plan
              with default loss function (softmax cross entropy and optimizer (naive stochaistic gradient descent), simply run:
              <code>def_training_plan(model, X, Y)</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additional specifiers can be passed into the training plan definition via a dictionary that allow you to change the
              loss function and optimizer to whatever is suitable for your model. This is described below.
            </p>
            <p>
              The training plan has 3 core components:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Loss Function.</strong> The loss function is defaulted to softmax cross entropy. To change it, pass in
              a dictionary containing item <code>"loss": my_loss_function</code> where <code>my_loss_function</code> is a functional
              definition of your loss function that takes input <code>my_loss_function(logits, targets, batch_size)</code>. Logits
              and targets must be numpy arrays of size <code>batch_size x C</code> and are the output of model and actual targets
              respectively. <code>artificienlib</code> also has some standard loss functions available out of the box. For
              instance, <code>"loss":sf.mse_with_logits</code> will use a standard implementation of mean squared error, no user
              created function instantiation required.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Optimizer.</strong> The optimizer is defaulted to naive stochaistic gradient descent. To change it, pass in
              a dictionary (same one as above) containing item <code>"optimizer": my_optimizer_function</code> where
              the <code>my_optimizer_function</code> is a functional definition of your optimizer function that takes
              input <code>my_optimizer_function(param, **kwargs)</code>. <code>kwargs</code> is simply a dictionary of basic
              parameters. For the purposes of defining an optimizer, <code>kwargs['lr']</code> will give you the learning rate.
              Param are the coefficients.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Training Steps.</strong> The training plan defines back propagation (i.e. how training happens at each
              iteration). A <code>training_plan</code> item and corresponding function in the dictionary would let you
              change it. It's unlikely this feature needs to be used, but if you'd like more information refer to
              <code>syftfunctions.py</code> in <code>artificienlib</code>: the library codebase.
            </p>
            <p>
              The outputs of a call to <code>def_training_plan(model, X, Y)</code> is our model parameters and a
              training plan object respectively. An example call to <code>def_training_plan(model, X, Y)</code> is below.
            </p>
            <CopyBlock
              text={trainingPlan}
              language="python"
              showLineNumbers
              theme={dracula}
              codeBlock
            />

            <h3 id="average">Define an averaging plan</h3>
            <p>
              Federated learning essentially compiles gradients from every dataset it's been trained on, then has to
              somehow combine these gradients together. For most usecases, these gradients are simply averaged together.
              This is the default setup, and the function <code>def_avg_plan(model_params)</code> does this. Pass in the
              <code>model_params</code> returned by <code>def_training_plan</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The outputs of a call to <code>def_avg_plan(model_params)</code> is an <code>avg_plan</code> object.
              An example call is below.
            </p>
            <CopyBlock
              text={averagingPlan}

              theme={dracula}
              codeBlock
            />

            <h3 id="sendModel">Send the model</h3>
            <p>
              Lastly, we must send our model, training plan, and average plan to be trained. Using the function <code>send_model</code> we
              must pass in the name, version, batch_size, learning_rate, max_updates, model_params, training_plan, average_plan,
              dataset_id, and password. An example call is below.
            </p>

              text={sendingModel}
              language="python"
