          <p>Artificien is the first of its kind marketplace that sells access to data, rather than data itself, and facilitates federated learning,
            a revolutionary technology paradigm where ML models are trained on-device, and data never has to leave the device.
            We offer a platform where enterprises can purchase access to previously unaccessible user data from app developers, and Artificien organizes the Federated Learning process on the backend.
